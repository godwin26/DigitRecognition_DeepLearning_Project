# Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This repository contains a **learning-focused deep learning project** that demonstrates how to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using a neural network trained on the **MNIST dataset**.

The project was developed primarily for **educational purposes** to understand the end-to-end workflow of a deep learning model, including data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🤖 Use of LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) were used **as a learning and study aid** to:
- Clarify deep learning concepts
- Understand TensorFlow/Keras APIs
- Improve code readability and structure

All implementation decisions and experimentation were performed by the author as part of the learning process.
